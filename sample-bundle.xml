  Random thoughts:
    - Parts of this are really drifting towards a workflow language like jBPM.

  TODO:
    - How can we reconcile Puppet metadata into this?
    - Should we point to specific versions of artifacts we're installing or
      upgrading? Or should these be specified at deployment time?
    - How do we survive errors? (which are guaranteed to occur at some point)
    - Prompting the user for input at deployment time.

      Small components we can re-use inside the larger user visible 'operations'. 

      Assume actions are always called with a target system tag which could 
      match multiple systems. In this case the action is run once per system
      sequentially. (perhaps we could add an option to run in parallel if it's
      safe to do so) Note that this is passed by the caller and only goes to 
      Jopr so we know which node(s) to execute the given action on.

      Possible action types: shell/Python script, Java class


      TODO:
      How can we pass actual parameters into actions? Passing to Java class 
      would be relatively easy, but to Python/shell I'm really not sure how.

      Perhaps we could get a little crazy and modify the scripts on the fly
      before sending them to the client to populate variables defined here.
      Not hard to inject SOMEVARIABLE=STRING at the start of the script text.
